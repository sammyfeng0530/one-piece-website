                    <p>
                        22 years ago, the Pirate King, Gol D. Roger, was executed. However, before his death he revealed
                        to everyone that his treasure, the One Piece, was hidden at the end of the Grand Line. This
                        inspired people to become pirates and sail toward the treasure, beginning the Great Age of
                        Pirates.

                    <p>
                        Twelve years later, a young boy named Monkey D. Luffy dreamed of finding the One Piece, but lost
                        the ability to swim after eating a Devil Fruit giving him the ability to stretch his body like
                        rubber. He was given a straw hat by the pirate Shanks, who would later go on to become a Yonko,
                        one of the four most powerful pirates in the world, on the agreement that he would return the
                        hat once he became a pirate and surpassed Shanks.

                    <p>
                        Ten years passed, and Luffy set off to sea at the age of 17. His infamy began to grow as he
                        formed the Straw Hat Pirates and defeated some of the East Blue's most notorious pirates. He
                        recruited four crewmates: Roronoa Zoro, who sought to become the greatest swordsman in the
                        world, Usopp, who sought to become a brave warrior of the sea, Sanji, who sought to find a
                        hidden sea known as the All Blue, and Nami, who sought to make a map of the world. He entered
                        the Grand Line with a bounty of Beli30,000,000 and was pursued by Smoker of the Marines.

                    <p>
                        In the Grand Line, Luffy and the Straw Hat Pirates became involved in a plot to dismantle the
                        criminal organization Baroque Works, led by Crocodile of the Shichibukai, seven pirates who work
                        for the World Government. The Straw Hats defeated Crocodile and dismantled Baroque Works,
                        earning the attention of higher-ranked officials in the World Government. They gained two
                        crewmates in the process, Tony Tony Chopper, who sought to cure every illness, and the
                        mysterious Nico Robin, formerly the second in command of Baroque Works.

                    <p>
                        The Straw Hats continued sailing through the Grand Line, but the conditions caused their ship
                        the Going Merry to take irreparable damage. Also, Robin turned herself in to the government in
                        order to save the Straw Hats from being annihilated. However, Luffy and his crew refused to let
                        her go and invaded the judicial island Enies Lobby, defeating the powerful group of government
                        assassins known as CP9. During the battle, it was revealed that Robin sought to find out about a
                        lost 100 years of history which the World Government does not want to be revealed. The Straw
                        Hats succeeded in rescuing Robin, but the Going Merry was ultimately destroyed after they
                        escaped.

                        they gained a new crewmate in Franky, who wanted to build a ship to go around the world, and he
                        built them the Thousand Sunny. The destruction of Enies Lobby caused the Straw Hats to be seen
                        as even more of a threat, and every crew member received a bounty.

                        wanted to reunite with Laboon, a whale his old crew was friends with many decades ago. The Straw
                        Hats defeated another Shichibukai, Gekko Moriah, and Brook joined their crew.

                        Luffy managed to break into Impel Down, the government's top prison facility, but failed to
                        reach Ace in time. He then led a mass breakout, and the other prisoners helped him reach
                        Marineford, where Ace is set to be executed. War broke out in Marineford as Whitebeard, Luffy
                        managed to free Ace, but Ace was killed after saving Luffy from Admiral Akainu. Luffy was taken
                        out of the battlefield as Whitebeard was overwhelmed by the Marines. Suddenly, Blackbeard
                        arrived with his crew, killed Whitebeard, and took his Devil Fruit power. Shanks then arrived
                        and ended the war.

                        Anguished by his inability to save Ace, Luffy sent a message to his crew telling them to train
                        and grow stronger for two years.

                        Two years later, the Straw Hats returned to the Grand Line and entered the New World. In the New
                        World, they formed an alliance with Trafalgar Law, one of the Eleven Supernovas, who sought to
                        bring down Kaido of the Yonko. They traveled through Punk Hazard and Dressrosa in order to
                        destroy factories supplying artificial Devil Fruits to Kaido, and took down the Shichibukai
                        Donquixote Doflamingo in the process.
